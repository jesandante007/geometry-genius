          Model. Through DOM we can manipulate web page. DOM is an object tree
          of a html document.It's an programming interface for web documents. By

        <li class="text-xl mt-10">How to select elements from dom?</li>
        <p class="border rounded-lg py-3 px-7">
          <span class="font-medium">Answer:</span> We can select dom elements in
          many ways. There are so many methods and tricks to grab elements or
          nodes from dom. We use then as per our needs. Some methods are given:
          <br />
          <span class="font-medium">document.getElementById()</span><br />
          <span class="font-medium">getElementsByTagName()</span><br />
          <span class="font-medium">getElementsByClassName()</span><br />
          <span class="font-medium">querySelector()</span><br />
          <span class="font-medium">querySelectorAll</span><br />

        <li class="text-xl mt-10">What is event bubble?</li>
        <div class="border rounded-lg py-3 px-7 lg:flex">
          <p>Answer: Event bubble is a concept of DOM. Let's say there are three
            event inside one another. So if the child event happens then it's
            parent event and grand parent event automatically happen. If parent
            event happens it's parent will automatically happen. This is like
            bubble in the deep water and it's raising up. So the bubbling concept
            is similar to that, event will always raising up to it's ancestors</p>

        <li class="text-xl mt-10">What is callback function?</li>
        <p class="border rounded-lg py-3 px-7">Answer: Callback function is a function which is passed as a parameter of another function's. When main function's work done then it execute callback function. Usually callback function uses when synchronous execution needed. Because JavaScript is asynchronous, means doesn't wait for a function to to execute it's next but invoked immediately. So where synchronous behavior need use callback function</p>
